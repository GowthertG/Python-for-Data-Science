# Python Data Structures Manipulation

This Python script demonstrates manipulation of various data structures including lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

## Overview

- The script defines several sample data structures:
  - `ft_list`: A list containing strings.
  - `ft_tuple`: A tuple containing strings.
  - `ft_set`: A set containing strings.
  - `ft_dict`: A dictionary containing key-value pairs of strings.
  
- It then performs various operations on these data structures to showcase their characteristics and manipulation capabilities.

## Operations

1. **List Manipulation**:
   - Modifying elements by index.
   
2. **Tuple Manipulation**:
   - Converting to a list, modifying, then converting back to a tuple to simulate mutation.

3. **Set Manipulation**:
   - Adding and removing elements. 

4. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - Updating values associated with keys.

## Usage

- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Run the script `Hello.py`.

```python
python Hello.py
```
