# Python Type Detection

This repository contains Python scripts for detecting the type of various objects.

## Description

The main script, `find_ft_type.py`, defines a function `all_thing_is_obj` that determines the type of an object and prints out the result. It handles various types such as lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, and strings.

The `tester.py` script imports the `all_thing_is_obj` function from `find_ft_type.py` and demonstrates its usage with sample data structures and objects.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Run the `tester.py` script.

```bash
python tester.py
```
